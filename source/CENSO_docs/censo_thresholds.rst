Thresholds
==========

CENSO is a threshold based sorting algorithm. The thresholds have been determined
for typical drug-like organic molecules up to 200 atoms. For cases with high 
flexibility or very different conformer ordering between SQM/FF and DFT it can be
necessary to increase the thresholds. If your target quantity is an averaged 
ensemble free energy, be sure not to use small energy windows in part0 and part1,
as this can falsely reduce the ensemble size.

In the following the employed thresholds are listed and their use is explained:

Part0 - Cheap Prescreening
--------------------------

part0_threshold = g_thr(0)
   :cml: ``-part0_threshold``
   :censorc: part0_threshold

part0_threshold **g_thr(0)** is an energy window /threshold in kcal/mol within 
which all conformers are considered. The CENSO internal default for g_thr(0) 
= 4.0 kcal/mol. The sorting threshold is designed to remove conformers very high 
lying in electronic energy (E).

Part1 - Prescreening
--------------------

In part1 two sorting steps are applied. One based on **g_thr(1)** with improved 
energy and solvation description and one on **G_thr(1)** where thermostatistical 
contributions have been calculated additionally.

part1_threshold = g_thr(1) and G_thr(1) 
    :cml: ``-part1_threshold``
    :censorc: part1_threshold

part1_threshold g_thr(1) is an energy window /threshold in kcal/mol within 
which all conformers are considered. The CENSO internal default for **g_thr(1)** 
= 3.5 kcal/mol. The sorting threshold **g_thr(1)** is designed to remove high 
lying conformers based on improved electronic energy (E) and solvation 
contributions (Î´G_solv). **G_thr(1)** sorting is based on full free energy 
including thermostatistical contributions (G_mRRHO). Both, **g_thr(1)** and 
**G_thr(1)** use the same base threshold e.g. 3.5 kcal/mol and **G_thr(1)** can be 
automatically increased as a function of the standard deviation of G_mRRHO in 
the structure ensemble, indicating high structural diversity and possibly larger 
errors (*fuzzy sorting*).

Part2 - Optimization
--------------------

In part2 two sorting thresholds are applied. One which is applied during geometry 
optimization and one Boltzmann sum threshold.

threshold applied during optimization G_thr(opt,2)
    :cml: ``-opt_limit``
    :censorc: opt_limit

Spearman-threshold for testing for parallel PES
    :cml: ``-spearmanthr``
    :censorc: spearmanthr

Boltzmann sum threshold G_thr(2)
    :cml: ``-thrpart2``
    :censorc: part2_threshold

The internal default for **G_thr(opt,2)** is set to 2.5 kcal/mol. During the 
geometry optimization the initial threshold **G_thr(opt,2)** is increased by 60 % 
(or at least 1.5 kcal/mol). If the PES can be assumed parallel 
(tested by a Spearman rank coefficient) the threshold is decresed until it 
reaches the initial value. All conformers with (free) energies above the 
**G_thr(opt,2)** threshold are discarded and all conformers below **G_thr(opt,2)** 
will by fully DFT optimized. The last threshold employed in part2 is a Boltzmann 
sum threshold **G_thr(2)** and all populated conformers of the ensemble, up to the 
Boltzmann population (in %) are considered further.

Part3 - Refinement
------------------

In part3 a Boltzmann sum threshold is employed.

Boltzmann sum threshold G_thr(3): 
    :cml: ``-thrpart3``
    :censorc: part3_threshold

Based on high level free energies Boltzmann weights are calculated and all 
conformers up to the Boltzmann sum threshold (in %) are considered further.

Part4 - NMR properties
----------------------

In part4 only Boltzmann sum thresholds of part2 **G_thr(2)** or part3 **G_thr(3)** 
are applied. It is possible to calculate part4 using Boltzmann weights from part1, 
but since there is no Boltzmann sum threshold in part1, in this case, the threshold 
**G_thr(2)** is used. The NMR properties are calculated on populated conformers up to 
the Boltzmann threshold in %.

Part5 - Optical rotatory dispersion
-----------------------------------

In part4 only Boltzmann sum thresholds of part2 **G_thr(2)** or part3 **G_thr(3)** 
are applied. It is possible to calculate part5 using Boltzmann weights from part1, 
but since there is no Boltzmann sum threshold in part1, in this case, the threshold 
**G_thr(2)** is used. The OR property is calculated on populated conformers up to the 
Boltzmann threshold in %. For optical rotation it is necessary to include almost the 
entire ensemble e.g. 99 %
