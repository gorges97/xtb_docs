This new update of the `QCxMS program <https://github.com/qcxms/QCxMS/releases/tag/v.5.1.2>`_ is linked against the AVX2  processor extension for increased performance. 
CID and EI runmode changes and bugfixes are implemented. The local run-script `pqcxms`  was re-written and now performs better for parallel calculations. 

For a detailed description of all changes, check out the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/qcxms>`_.
