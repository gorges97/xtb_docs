We released a new version of DFT-D4 further expanding the functionality of the Python API and the integration with QCEngine and ASE.
In this process we simplified the installation of the Python extension module which should now also be possible with pip.
The DFT-D4 program can now also calculate pairwise resolved dispersion energies, both for the pairwise additive and pairwise non-additive contributions to the total dispersion energy.
